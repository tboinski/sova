 * <p/>
 * This composite change will convert a primitive class to a defined class by replacing subclass
 * axioms where the class in question is on the left hand side of the subclass axiom to an
 * equivalent classes axiom which makes the class equivalent to the intersection of its superclasses.
 * <p/>
 * More formally, given a class A, a set of ontologies S, and a target targetOntology T, for each targetOntology
 * O in S, subclass axioms whose LHS is A will be removed from O.  The superclasses from these axioms
 * will be combined into an intersection class which will be made equivalent to A using an equivalent
 * classes axioms E.  E will be added to the target targetOntology T.
 * <p/>
 * This composite change supports the pattern of working where a primitive class is converted to
 * a defined class - functionality which is usually found in editors.

 * A utility class that can be used to determine is a class is a syntactic direct
 * subclass of owl:Thing.  A class is considered NOT to be a syntactic direct subclass
 * of owl:Thing if ANY of the following conditions apply:
 * <p/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>It is equal to the left hand side of a subclass axiom, where the right hand side
 * is a named class other than owl:Thing</li>
 * <li>It is an operand in an equivalent class axiom where at least one of the other other
 * operands is an intersection class that has a named operand other than the class in question.
 * For example  <code>EquivalentClasses(A,  (B and prop some C))</code></li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * This functionality is provided because it is useful for displaying class hierarchies in
 * editors and browsers.  In these situations it is needed because not all "orphan" classes
 * are asserted to be subclasses of owl:Thing.  For example, if the only referencing axiom
 * of class A was ObjectDomain(propP A) then A is a syntactic subclass of owl:Thing

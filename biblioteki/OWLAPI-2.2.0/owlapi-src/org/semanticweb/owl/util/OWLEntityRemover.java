 * remove an entity from a set of ontologies.  This is accomplished by removing
 * all axioms that refer to the entity.  The entity remover follows the visitor
 * design pattern, entities that need to be removed from an ontology should
 * accept visits from the entity remover.  Changes are accumulated as the entity
 * remover visits various entities.

 * An input source provides a point for loading an ontology.
 * An input source may provide three forms
 * of obtaining a concrete representation of an ontology 1) From a
 * <code>Reader</code>, 2) From and <code>InputStream</code> 3) From
 * a physical URI.  Consumers which use an input source will attempt
 * to obtain a concrete representation of an ontology in the above
 * order.
 *
 * While an ontology input source may appear similar to a SAX input
 * source, an important difference is that the getReader and getInputStream
 * methods return new instances each time the method is called.  This allows
 * multiple attempts at loading an ontology.

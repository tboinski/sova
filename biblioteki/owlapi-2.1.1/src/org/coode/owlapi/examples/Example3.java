            // resembles a Web address (i.e. http://...), but it is important to realise that
            // the ontology URI might not necessarily be resolvable.  In other words, we
            // can't necessarily get a document from the URI corresponding to the ontology
            // URI, which represents the ontology.
            // In order to have a concrete representation of an ontology (e.g. an RDF/XML
            // file), we MAP the ontology URI to a PHYSICAL URI.  We do this using a URIMapper

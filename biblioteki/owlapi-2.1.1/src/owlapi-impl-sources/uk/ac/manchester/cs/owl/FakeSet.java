 * A set which is really backed by a list.  This is used in the reference implementation
 * of OWLOntology (OWLOntologyImpl) because it improves performance with respect to speed
 * and memory consumption.  This class should be used with CAUTION - in particular, the
 * user must know that there aren't duplicates when adding elements.
 *
 * Changed back to hash set - this class should proabably be deprecated because although
 * loading is very fast, removal of axioms is slowed down.

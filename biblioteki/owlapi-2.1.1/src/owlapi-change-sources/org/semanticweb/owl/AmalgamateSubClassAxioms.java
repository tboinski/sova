 * Given a set of ontologies S, for each ontology, O, in S, this change
 * combines multiple subclass axioms with a common left hand side into
 * one subclass axiom.  For example, given A subClassOf B, A subClassOf C,
 * this change will remove these two axioms and replace them by adding
 * one subclass axiom, A subClassOf (B and C).

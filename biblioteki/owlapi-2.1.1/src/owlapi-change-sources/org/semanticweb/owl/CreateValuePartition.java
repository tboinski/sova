 * This composite change will create a value partion - see "pattern 2" in
 * "Representing Specified Values in OWL: "value partitions" and "value sets""
 * (http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-specified-values.)
 * <p/>
 * A value partition is an ontology design pattern which is used to represent
 * a set of closed values for a particular property.  For example the property
 * hasSize might only take values from SmallSize, MediumSize and LargeSize.  In
 * this case, the value partition is Size, and has the values SmallSize, MediumSize
 * and LargeSize.  This composite change will set hasSize to be functional and its
 * range as Size.  Size will be covered by SmallSize, MediumSize and LargeSize and
 * these classes which represent the values will be made disjoint with eachother.
